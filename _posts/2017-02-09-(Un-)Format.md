![White Macbook running Xubuntu]({{ site.baseurl }}/gfx/posts/whitemacbook_small.jpg "White Macbook running Xubuntu"){: .thumb} I recently wiped a white Macbook 3.1 from 2007 to install Xubuntu. It turned out that important data was lost during this (or even during a re-installation two years ago).

Luckily, with some magic I was able to restore all lost data. <!-- more --> For this, I used the free software [PhotoRec](http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec) by [Monsieur Grenier](http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/CV_Christophe_GRENIER). In Ubuntu, it can be installed as a bundle with [TestDisk](http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk) (which is another great tool) using `sudo apt-get install testdisk`. Launch `sudo photorec` for root access.

The first step is to select the disk to work on (in my case `/dev/sda`). I also have an external hard drive (`/dev/sdb`) hooked up to store recovered data somewhere else and to not overwrite any potentially yet un-recovered data.

Since I partitioned the disk during re-installation, I choose the *[Whole disk]* rather than any partition for recovery. For speed, it is recommended to limit data recovery to the relevant filetypes (f.e. .pdf, .jpg and .zip) using the *File Opt* menu.

The software needs to know the filesystem type. The laptop was running OS X prior re-installation so my choice is *Other*.

Recovery starts after selecting the output folder (for me `/dev/sdb/`). [PhotoRec](http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec) reports all recoveries while running and can take multiple hours. This also depends on the second hard drive to store the recovered files - the faster, the better.

Recovered files are stored in folders `recup_dir.1`, `recup_dir.2`, ...

... And there are multiple ways of restoring the original filenames or sorting the recovered files [here](http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/After_Using_PhotoRec).

Well, everybody was absolutely ecstatic to restore the lost data! Thank you, [Monsieur Grenier](http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/CV_Christophe_GRENIER)! And btw, [Xubuntu](http://www.xubuntu.org/) runs awesome on this device!
